# Water APP 
# The introduction
Welcome to the Water app! This app is designed to help you learn how to save water in your daily life. We understand that small changes can make a big difference when it comes to water conservation, and that's why we've created this app to help you take action.
Before you get started, we would like to ask you a few questions about your current water consumption habits. This survey will help us understand how you currently use water, and it will also serve as a benchmark to measure the impact of the tasks we will be suggesting later on.
Once you've completed the survey, you'll have access to 21 simple tasks that will help you reduce your water usage. These tasks are easy to follow and can be implemented immediately. They cover a wide range of areas, from reducing food waste to fixing leaks, and from installing low-flow shower heads to taking shorter showers.
By making small changes in your daily routine, you can make a big impact on water conservation. We hope that this app will help you learn how to save water and make a difference in your community. Thank you for your commitment to water conservation!


# 21 Task list 
1. Only wash full loads of laundry and dishes - By only running your washing machine and dishwasher when they are completely full, you can save a significant amount of water. A full load of laundry typically uses around 150 liters of water, while a full load of dishes uses around 22.5 liters. This can save up to 112.5 liters of water per load.
2. Fix any leaks in your faucets or pipes - Leaks can waste a lot of water over time. A single leaky faucet can waste more than 11,355 liters of water per year. To fix a leak, you can turn off the water supply to the faucet, remove the handle, and replace the washer or O-ring. You can also call a plumber if you are not comfortable doing it yourself.
3. Install low-flow shower heads and toilets - Low-flow showerheads and toilets use less water than traditional models. A low-flow showerhead uses around 7.5 liters of water per minute, while a traditional showerhead uses around 15 liters per minute. A low-flow toilet uses around 6 liters per flush, while a traditional toilet uses around 13.2 liters per flush.
4. Don't let the water run while brushing your teeth or shaving - It's easy to waste a lot of water while brushing your teeth or shaving. By turning off the water while you're brushing your teeth or shaving, you can save around 18.9 liters of water per day.
5. Only water your lawn and garden when necessary - Overwatering your lawn and garden can waste a lot of water. By only watering your lawn and garden when necessary, you can save a significant amount of water. A good rule of thumb is to only water your lawn and garden when the soil is dry to the touch.

7. Use a broom instead of a hose to clean driveways and sidewalks - Cleaning driveways and sidewalks with a hose can waste a lot of water. By using a broom instead, you can save around 18.9 liters of water per minute.
8. Plant drought-resistant plants in your garden - Drought-resistant plants require less water than traditional plants. By planting drought-resistant plants in your garden, you can save a significant amount of water.
9. Use a pool cover to reduce evaporation - A pool cover can reduce evaporation by up to 90%, which can save a significant amount of water over time.—suggest another?
10. Take shorter showers - Showering is one of the main ways we use water in our homes. By taking shorter showers, you can save a significant amount of water. A 5-minute shower can use around 75 liters of water, while a 10-minute shower can use around 150 liters.
11. Use a bucket to catch the water while waiting for it to warm up, then use it to water plants - When you turn on the tap to wait for the water to warm up, you can catch the water in a bucket and use it to water your plants.
12. Use a low-flow toilet flush or a dual flush toilet - Low-flow toilets and dual flush toilets use less water per flush than traditional toilets, which can save a significant amount of water over time.
13. Use a hand-held hose nozzle to control the water flow while watering plants - A hand-held hose nozzle allows you to control the water flow while watering your plants, which can help you save water.
14. Use a hose nozzle that can be shut off when not in use - A hose nozzle with a shut-off feature allows you to turn off the water flow when not in use, which can help save water.
15. Use a refillable water bottle instead of disposable plastic bottles - By using a refillable water bottle instead of disposable plastic bottles, you can save water used in the production and disposal of plastic bottles.
16. Use a bucket to catch water while waiting for it to warm up, then use it to water plants - When you turn on the tap to wait for the water to warm up, you can catch the water in a bucket and use it to water your plants.
17. Use a low-flow toilet flush or a dual flush toilet - Low-flow toilets and dual flush toilets use less water per flush than traditional toilets, which can save a significant amount of water over time.
18. Choose products made from sustainable materials, such as bamboo instead of cotton, which require less water to grow - By choosing products made from sustainable materials, like bamboo, you can help reduce the amount of water needed to produce them.
19. Use a spray mop instead of using a bucket of water when cleaning the home- A spray mop allows you to use only the necessary amount of water to clean your home and this can help save water.
20. Do not rinse the dishes before putting them in the machine- by not rinsing the dishes before putting them in the machine, you can save around 21 liters of water per load.

21.Educating others: Spreading awareness about the negative effects of plastic bottles on the environment and encouraging others to reduce their usage can make a big impact.

# About the app tech
 
This is a mobile application that provides daily tasks for the user to do to reduce their carbon footprint. The app features a task screen that displays a task with a title, description, and image, and a completion button. Completed tasks are stored in the local storage of the app using AsyncStorage.

The app also features a profile screen that displays the username of the logged-in user and a sign-out button. Users can sign in using the AuthContext, which authenticates users with a username and password.

The app is built with React Native and uses several libraries, including React Navigation for screen navigation, React Native Vector Icons for displaying icons, and AsyncStorage for local storage. It follows a simple, clean architecture and is designed to be easily extensible with new features.
